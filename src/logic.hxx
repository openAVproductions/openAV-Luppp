/** Logic
 *  This class contains an interface exposing most functionality in Luppp. The
 *  interface is used to have one central place from where each controller can
 *  interact with Luppp using the same function calls.
 *
 *  This class should be used for input from any device. The interface is
 *  deliberatly specific with regards to scheduling events: controllers should
 *  NOT attempt to schedule changes: use the provided functions directly when
 *  events occur on a controller.
 *
 *  The ControllerUpdater class is the opposite of this class, it provides
 *  feedback of each event that occurs.
 *
 *  Note: The GridLogic class provides the interface to scene selection / state.
